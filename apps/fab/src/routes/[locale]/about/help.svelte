		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			Find-A-Bible is a web-directory of known Bibles Resources available in the
			many languages of the world. It was created to simplify the process of
			discovering and securing Bibles in foreign languages.
		</p>
		<p>
			Find-A-Bible was first created in 2006 by the Forum of Bible Agencies
			(FOBAI) as a way to help people discover and secure Bibles by language or
			country. The project originally featured Bible resources from FOBAI but
			has been expanded to show resources from over 900 agencies. Pioneer Bible
			Translation International (pbti.org) initially created and maintained the
			site. Since 2013, the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org) has voluntarily
			programmed and maintained the site and its databases.
		</p>

		<h3>Mission</h3>
		<p>
			Find-A-Bible is intended to serve any person or agency looking to secure
			Bible resources by language or by geographical region. Toward that end, a
			considerable amount of data is provided which is intended to assist in
			discovering, securing and distributing Bible resources. Our goal is to
			make this process as simple as possible, whether it be to provide a single
			Bible to a neighbor, or to plan massive distribution initiatives on a
			country-wide scale.
		</p>

		<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		<p>
			One of the best ways to get started is by simply asking questions. We have
			provided three scenarios that may be of help in understanding the site.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scenario #1: My neighbor speaks a language of India called Gujarati and is
			asking for a Bible in their language.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				On the main page, find and click India on the map. Or choose the
				Countries Button on the top of the page.
			</li>
			<li>
				You will see the 500+ languages of India sorted by population. If you
				see their language (Gujarati) click on it to go to that language page.
				(Or you can start typing the name of the language in the filter box.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Once you are on the Gujarati language page, select a Bible by title (or
				you can also select the FILMS or RESOURCES tabs to select additional
				resources in that language).
			</li>
			<li>
				From there you can find a variety of printed Bibles, online Bibles,
				downloadable Bibles or Bible Apps.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Scenario #2: My church is sending a missions group to Mexico and we would
			like to bring Bibles.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				From the top menu select <a href="/{$locale}/countries">COUNTRIES</a>
				. You will see that Mexico has about 129 million people who speak 300+ languages.
			</li>
			<li>
				Click the Mexico page and you will see those languages sorted by
				population spoken inside the country of Mexico.
			</li>
			<li>
				Select Mexico Maps and Info. Use the provided maps to research which
				languages your group might encounter by geography. Click on the pin to
				view resources in a given language.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Scenario #3: Our missions agency is seeking to create content for and
			partner with agencies working in Africa.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				There are a number of functions that may be of assistance here. From the
				top menu select LANGUAGES. From the sidebar you can filter by Continent.
				Select Africa.
			</li>
			<li>
				The languages of Africa are sorted by Bible Content, but by clicking the
				arrows on Population, you can see the population of each language -
				showing the most populous languages of Africa.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can also sort by Country and to see the languages for each Country.
				From there you can click on each country or each language to explore
				more possibilities.
			</li>
			<li>
				From the top menu select AGENCIES, then select the Agencies tab to view
				the organizations listed in Find.Bible. In the filter box on the left,
				select Africa to see the African based organizations working in the
				Bible world.
			</li>
		</ol>

	<h3>Front Page</h3>
	<p>
		The world map shown here dates back to the original Find-A-Bible (FAB). We
		added some additional data that allow it to be more functional. The
		ORGANIZATIONS tab shows those groups who are included in the Find-A-Bible
		(FAB) database. The WORLD WATCH LIST tab shows the nations of the world
		where Christian persecution is most prominent (as referenced by Open Doors
		International www.odi.org). The map can be zoomed in and any country can be
		selected which will take you directly to that country page.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, there is a SEARCH icon in the upper right banner of each page
		that allows you to enter any text to search the entire site, or filter the
		possible results. This is intended to give you quick access to identify
		languages even when you may not know the spelling of the name.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Find-A-Bible (FAB) interface can be translated into a number of major
		languages. Those languages can be accessed from any page by clicking the
		TRANSLATION icon in the banner of each page.
	</p>

	<h3>Bibles Pages</h3>
	<p>
		The BIBLES page presents a solution to the nearly impossible dream of
		providing active links to the Bible versions in every language of the world
		where they exist. The difficulty is that while many organizations are
		working very hard to create and publish Bibles in print, audio, film and
		story, they are also working hard to create and update websites where those
		Bibles resources can be purchased or accessed. When an organization updates
		their websites, their previous links are often broken, making this task
		quite challenging. (Unless, of course, they notify us of the updates.)
	</p>
	<p>
		On the BIBLES page, you can sort by name, country, or language to discover
		resources. You can also type a Bible name, country or language into the
		filter bar to zero in on your targets. On the left side of your screen you
		will see filters that enable you to filter the results by type or by
		continent.
	</p>
	<p>
		A quick pointer: On the Bible page, you can jump directly into a specific
		Bible page where you can see available links to that Bible. You can also
		launch directly into the pages made for each language and each country.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a “View Results” box just below the banner and next to the filter
		box. This dropdown allows you to select the number of results shown on each
		page.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recently added to the Bibles page is the option to view FILMS or RESOURCES
		in the FAB database. By selecting these tabs you can use the same search
		conventions to locate, view, listen to, or download resources for your
		missions work. To download a film, simply click the FILMS tab and select a
		film to play. Depending upon your internet browser, you should be able to
		right click on the playing film and select download.
	</p>

	<h3>Languages Pages</h3>
	<p>
		There are some 7900 languages in the world, many of which have Bible
		resources that have been created. Those languages are shown here, each on
		their unique page. Although some languages do not have resources associated
		with them yet, new Bibles are being translated faster than ever. Hundreds of
		content creators are creating Bible resources and films faster than ever
		imagined.
	</p>
	<p>
		The world's languages can be displayed and sorted by country, population,
		ISO code, or the number of Bible resource links that occur in Find-A-Bible
		(FAB). The languages are named and arranged by SIL's ISO code. Much of the
		information on each particular language page is derived from Wikipedia,
		Joshua Project, The Glotologue, and others. For a more comprehensive and
		authoritative study of each language, please refer to the SIL Ethnologue -
		the world's foremost authority on languages.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where there is content in a particular language, you can view either BIBLES,
		FILMS or RESOURCES from the tabs on each language page.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also provided from the LANGUAGES page are some handy LANGUAGE FAMILY MAPS
		that may assist in doing some basic research.
	</p>
	<p>
		With deep gratitude to such Bibles agencies as Wycliff Bible Translators,
		Global Recording Network, Faith Comes by Hearing, The Jesus Film Project and
		quite a few others, Bible resources in new languages are being added all the
		time.
	</p>

	<h3>Countries Pages</h3>
	<p>
		Most missions organizations think in terms of countries when it comes to
		their work. The COUNTRY pages were designed to assist in the research and
		rapid discovery of the languages that might be encountered in a given
		country.
	</p>
	<p>
		Upon visiting the COUNTRIES page, the user is presented with a table of
		helpful data in accessing the need and scope of critical elements by
		country. Provided are sortable columns that include population, number of
		spoken languages, refugee count, literacy, and level of the persecution (as
		researched by the OpenDoors WorldWatch List). You can also compare nations
		by Continents or Territories using the filter boxes on the left. Take a
		minute to play with the different sort functions while you filter by
		continent. We think you will find it helpful and illuminating.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you click on a given COUNTRY, you will be taken to that page where you
		will find a list of languages known to be spoken in that country. These
		languages are initially sorted by a population estimate of speakers in that
		country. In theory, those with a greater number of speakers will most likely
		be the languages you encounter should you travel there. Also provided is a
		variety of information and links that might assist in your research. For
		each COUNTRY, an additional tab is provided giving you access to
		information, maps and links.
	</p>

	<h3>Agencies Pages</h3>
	<p>
		As a service to the Forum of Bible Agencies and the many Bible agencies of
		the world, these pages are added to allow quick identification of which of
		their resources are discoverable in Find-A-Bible, and where they are being
		shared by other sites.
	</p>
	<p>
		Listed from the FOBAI tab are the members of the Forum of Bible Agencies
		International. The second tab lists all the agencies included in the
		Find-A-Bible database.
	</p>
	<p>
		Doubtless, many agencies will discover that we have missed some of their
		resources. For which, we apologize in advance. For those, you will find a
		submission page under the ABOUT link on the top menu. Let us know what you
		have and where it can be accessed and we will add those as we are able.
	</p>

	<h3>About Pages</h3>
	<p>
		In the ABOUT pages you will find tabs that will present the project
		overview, answer FAQs, get help, provide easy ways to SUGGEST content
		additions, and a CONTACT page. If you desire to add content in bulk, you can
		download a CONTENT FORM from the SUGGEST BIBLES tab, as well. The Digital
		Bible Society is honored to be a part of this project. And, we are indebted
		to those members of FOBAI for their foresight in creating API systems to
		track and deliver the Bible content they have created.
