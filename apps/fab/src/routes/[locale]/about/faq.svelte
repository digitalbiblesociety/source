			"Find-A-Bible (FAB) is a web directory providing links to Bibles and biblical resources in the 7000+ languages of the world. The FAB directory primarily consists of content created by members of the Forum of Bible Agencies International (FOBAI) and is intended to help users discover and obtain Scriptures and biblical resources in the language and media of their choice for discipleship, evangelism, and church planting.  Find-A-Bible also features links to print Bibles, print-on-demand Bibles, digital Bibles, audio Bibles, visual Bibles and Bible resources – in multiple formats.",

		description:
			'The mission of Find-A-Bible is to ensure that the world’s Bibles and great biblical resources are easily found and shared. While it is possible to search for a great many Biblical resources online, the sheer quantity of available content is overwhelming. Consequently, FOBAI launched Find-A-Bible in 2006, and it was maintained by <a href="http://pbti.org" target="_blank">Pioneer Bible Translators</a>. In 2013, FOBAI commissioned the <a href="https://dbs.org" target="_blank">Digital Bible Society</a> (DBS) to recreate Find-A-Bible and maintain a single location on the internet where people looking for Bible resources can identify and obtain them.',

		description:
			"Find-A-Bible is the single digital platform where the major Bible agencies of the world and their affiliates have agreed to collaborate together to ensure that all Bibles and biblical resources are easily discoverable – in every language. Find-A-Bible was built to be a convenient hub delivering fast, accurate, and relevant information with minimal user effort. Also, it serves as a reference point for Bible translation organizations seeking to discover what Bibles have or have not been published in a specific language.",

		title: "Who is FOBAI and its members?",

			"The Bible-based resources available in the Find-A-Bible directory are the property of the individual members of FOBAI or the organizations of multiple Bible Agencies around the world. Although some material accessible through Find-A-Bible is freely available to the public, other resources are offered for sale from  various websites. Find-A-Bible does not own any copyrights for any of the discoverable resources nor does it offer resources for sale.",

		title: "Whose work is reflected on the Find-A-Bible website?",
		icon: "/img/fab_color_team.svg",
		description:
			'The massive database employed by Find-A-Bible is a reflection of decades of work by dozens of individuals. The website itself was designed and is maintained by <a href="https://dbs.org" target="_blank">Digital Bible Society</a>, initially from a grant from <a href="https://bibleleague.ca/" target="_blank">BibleLeague of Canada</a>, but now as a volunteer project on behalf of FOBAI. As an increasing number of Bible agencies produce an increasing volume of content in the world\'s languages, Find-A-Bible will become more essential and far more of a challenge. <a href="https://find.bible/about/contact">We need your help!</a>',

			'We welcome your support in spreading the word that Find-A-Bible exists. And if you, or if you know people, who are good at research and have a heart for missions, we sure could use your help. We need help with the discovery and the information about Bible and Bible-based content that is not in this directory.
