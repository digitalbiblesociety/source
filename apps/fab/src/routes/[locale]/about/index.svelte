			<h4>The Project</h4>
			<p>
				Find-A-Bible (FAB) is a web directory providing links to Bibles and
				biblical resources in the 7000+ languages of the world. The FAB
				directory primarily consists of content created by members of the Forum
				of Bible Agencies International (FOBAI) and is intended to help users
				discover and obtain Scriptures and biblical resources in the language
				and media of their choice for discipleship, evangelism, and church
				planting. Find-A-Bible also features links to print Bibles,
				print-on-demand Bibles, digital Bibles, audio Bibles, visual Bibles and
				Bible resources – in multiple formats.
			</p>
			<p>
				Find-A-Bible is a collaborative project by the Forum of Bible Agencies
				International built to increase the Bible's accessibility and to
				facilitate access to scripture. The Find-A-Bible design, interphase, and
				database was created and is maintained by the Digital Bible Society
				(dbs.org).

			<h4 class="medium-mb2">Data Sources</h4>
			<p>
				Find-A-Bible exists to provide tools that simplify the discovery of
				existing Bible resources. Find-A-Bible also exists to inform missions
				workers of what languages they may likely encounter in given regions and
				then to equip them with resources that will serve their mission. Toward
				those goals, Find-A-Bible draws upon data derived from a wide variety of
				reliable open sources, and in some case uses calculates averages and
				best estimates for determining numbers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consequently, <b>
					Find-A-Bible should NOT be considered a definitive source for global
					and linguistic data and statistics
				</b>
				. For reliable and authoritative data, we strongly recommend you refer to
				the latest version of the
