	<p>
		We sell all of our products at cost without adding additional surcharges or
		fees. to cover our expenses because of this all our <b>official policy</b>
		is that
		<b>all sales are final and no refunds will be issued</b>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that being said we often accept returns if the product was faulty in
		some way or if circumstances change after the purchase making the cost an
		undo hardship. Just get in touch and we'll probably be able to work
		something out for you.
